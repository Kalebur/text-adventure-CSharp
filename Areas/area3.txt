Name: a zombie cook
Short Description: a zombie cook
Long Description: A zombie in a tattered apron and trousers is shuffling about.
Description: You see nothing special about it. Nope. Not a thing. Absolutely nothing. It's the most UN-special zombie ever to exist. Zombies are just part of every day life. You should already know what a zombie looks like, therefore it's pointless to describe it any further.\n\nHmm? What's that? Is it a man or a woman? Human? Elf? Dwarf? Look, it's a zombie. I already said you see NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. Stop asking questions! Geez! You'd think you want details in your games or something. Dang millenials...
